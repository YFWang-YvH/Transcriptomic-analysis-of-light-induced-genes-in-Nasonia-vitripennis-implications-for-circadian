# Transcriptomic-analysis-of-light-induced-genes-in-Nasonia-vitripennis-implications-for-circadian

This folder contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the analysis of RNAseq data from Nasonia vitripennis, published in (journal) - Transcriptomic analysis of light-induced genes in Nasonia vitripennis: implications for circadian light entrainment pathways.

All used packages and software versions are reported in the manuscript.

The raw RNAseq reads can be found on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession no. PRJEB57723. All processed data used to run the analysis can be found on (data archive), including the final gene counts matrix, sample information file, GO annotation table, and all supplementary data files (RNAseq data quality, Genome mapping stats, DEGs list, GO analysis outputs, KEGG analysis ouput, and motif analysis output).
